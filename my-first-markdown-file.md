# Hello Markdown
It is **soooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remeber the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

Now you can be a wiz at this language and code up stuff like `console.writeline("Hello Markdown!")`;

Can't remenber the language? No probleme! Just visit one of these resources:
